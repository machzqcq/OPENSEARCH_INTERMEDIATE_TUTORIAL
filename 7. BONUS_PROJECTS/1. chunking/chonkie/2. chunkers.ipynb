    "# ⚡ 5. LateChunker: Document-Level Contextual Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The **LateChunker** implements the \"Late Chunking\" algorithm from the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701). Unlike traditional methods that embed each chunk independently, LateChunker first generates a document-level embedding and then derives chunk embeddings from it. This provides richer contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- ✅ Document-level context preservation\n",
    "- ✅ Embeddings capture broader context\n",
    "- ✅ Built on RecursiveChunker base\n",
    "- ✅ Better retrieval performance in RAG systems\n",
    "- ✅ Each chunk includes its embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. Encodes entire document into single embedding\n",
    "2. Splits text using recursive rules\n",
    "3. Derives chunk embeddings from document embedding\n",
    "4. Each chunk carries broader contextual information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Advanced RAG applications\n",
    "- When document-level context is important\n",
    "- Improved retrieval accuracy\n",
    "- Semantic search with rich context"

    "- **SentenceChunker**: Good balance of speed and context preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Production Systems:\n",
    "- **TokenChunker**: Most predictable, great for scaling\n",
    "- **RecursiveChunker**: Good for structured content with clear hierarchy\n",
    "- Use smaller `chunk_size` for more precise retrieval, larger for more context\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Code Documentation:\n",
    "- **CodeChunker**: Only choice for respecting code syntax\n",
    "- Set smaller chunk_size (256-512) to keep functions/classes together"

Machine learning algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, enabling computers to perform tasks that once seemed exclusively human. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns in data. These networks can recognize images, understand natural language, and even generate creative content. The impact of AI extends across multiple industries. In healthcare, machine learning models can diagnose diseases from medical images with accuracy rivaling expert physicians.\n",

    "# 🎓 Conclusion and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different chunkers for different needs**: No one-size-fits-all solution exists. Choose based on your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic chunkers are powerful**: SemanticChunker and LateChunker provide superior context preservation at the cost of processing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Token size matters**: Smaller chunks = more precise retrieval, larger chunks = more context per chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code requires special handling**: Always use CodeChunker for source code to respect syntax and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overlap helps continuity**: Using chunk_overlap prevents information loss at boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### For RAG Applications:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# High accuracy, slower\n",
    "chunker = SemanticChunker(threshold=0.7, chunk_size=512)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Best retrieval performance\n",
    "chunker = LateChunker(chunk_size=512)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fast and reliable\n",
    "chunker = SentenceChunker(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Production Systems:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Predictable and scalable\n",
    "chunker = TokenChunker(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structured documents\n",
    "chunker = RecursiveChunker.from_recipe(\"markdown\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Code Documentation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "chunker = CodeChunker(language=\"python\", chunk_size=256)\n",
    "\n",
    "# JavaScript code\n",
    "chunker = CodeChunker(language=\"javascript\", chunk_size=256)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
