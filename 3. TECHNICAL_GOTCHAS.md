# 🚀 Installation
- ⚠️ `sudo swapoff -a` - I did not do this as Increased risk of system crashes: Without a pagefile, when physical RAM runs out, the system or software will instantly crash instead of slowing down as it would with paging enabled
- ⚙️ `sysctl vm.max_map_count` - default 65530, Increase temporarily in the shell `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`, permanently add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`
- 📤 `curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -X PUT "https://localhost:9200/ecommerce" -ku admin:<custom-admin-password> --data-binary "@ecommerce-field_mappings.json"`
- 📤 `curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -X PUT "https://localhost:9200/ecommerce/_bulk" -ku admin:<custom-admin-password> --data-binary "@ecommerce.json"`

# 🐍 Python

- 📦 Using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as python package manager (various reasons - read online. The biggest benefit for me was speed)
- ⬇️ Install uv - `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- 🔧 `cd opensearch` and run the command `uv sync` - Will create a .venv directory that contains your python client environment
