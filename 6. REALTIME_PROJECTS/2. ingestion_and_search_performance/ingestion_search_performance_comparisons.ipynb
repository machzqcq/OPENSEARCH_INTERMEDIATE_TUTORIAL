    "1. **Analyzer Comparison**: Test multiple text analyzers and measure ingestion performance\n",
    "2. **Query Strategy**: Compare search effectiveness across different analyzers\n",
    "3. **Neural Search**: Implement vector-based semantic search using sentence transformers\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine lexical (BM25) and semantic (Neural) search for optimal results\n",

    "## 🎓 Summary & Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis compared multiple approaches for indexing and searching the SQUAD dataset in OpenSearch:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Phase 1: Text Analyzers\n",
    "We tested 5 different analyzers (standard, english, keyword, whitespace, simple) and measured:\n",
    "- **Ingestion Performance**: Throughput (docs/sec), time, and index size\n",
    "- **Key Finding**: Different analyzers have similar ingestion speeds but vary in index size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Phase 2: Query Performance  \n",
    "We executed various query types (match, multi_match, match_phrase) across all analyzer indices:\n",
    "- **Latency Comparison**: Measured query response times\n",
    "- **Relevance Scoring**: Compared how well each analyzer returned relevant results\n",
    "- **Key Finding**: Analyzer choice significantly impacts relevance for different query types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Phase 3: Neural Search\n",
    "We deployed a sentence transformer model and created vector embeddings:\n",
    "- **Model**: huggingface/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-tas-b\n",
    "- **Vectorized Fields**: title, context, question, answers (all except id)\n",
    "- **Trade-offs**: Slower ingestion, larger index size, but semantic understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Phase 4: Search Strategy Comparison\n",
    "We compared three search approaches:\n",
    "1. **BM25 (Traditional)**: Fast lexical matching\n",
    "2. **Neural (k-NN)**: Semantic vector similarity  \n",
    "3. **Hybrid**: Combined approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Speed vs Semantics**: BM25 is fastest but neural search understands meaning\n",
    "- **Resource Requirements**: Neural search needs deployed models and more storage\n",
    "- **Production Recommendation**: Hybrid search for best overall results\n",
    "- **Use Case Matters**: Choose strategy based on query patterns and requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**: \n",
    "- Tune analyzer settings for specific use cases\n",
    "- Experiment with different embedding models\n",
    "- Implement re-ranking strategies\n",
    "- Add search result evaluation metrics (NDCG, MRR, MAP)"
