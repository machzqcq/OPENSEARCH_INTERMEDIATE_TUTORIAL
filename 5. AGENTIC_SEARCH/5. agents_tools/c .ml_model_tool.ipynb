       "Configuring an OpenSearch cluster for production use, especially with an expected data ingestion of 100GB daily, requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including hardware, index management, replication, sharding, and monitoring. Below are the key steps and recommendations to set up your OpenSearch cluster effectively:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Cluster Sizing and Hardware Configuration**\n",
       "\n",
       "#### a. **Node Types**\n",
       "- **Master Nodes**: Dedicated nodes for cluster management. Typically, you should have at least 3 master-eligible nodes to ensure high availability.\n",
       "- **Data Nodes**: Nodes that store the actual data and handle search and indexing requests. The number of data nodes will depend on your data volume and query load.\n",
       "- **Ingest Nodes**: Optional nodes that can preprocess documents before indexing. Useful if you have complex data transformations.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### b. **Hardware Specifications**\n",
       "- **CPU**: At least 8 cores per node for data nodes, more if you expect heavy query loads.\n",
       "- **Memory**: Allocate 50% of the available RAM to the JVM heap, but do not exceed 32GB for the heap size. For example, if you have 64GB of RAM, set the heap size to 32GB.\n",
       "- **Disk**: Use SSDs for better performance. Plan for at least 3 times your expected daily data ingestion for storage. For 100GB daily, aim for at least 300GB of disk space per data node, considering replicas and overhead.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Index Management**\n",
       "\n",
       "#### a. **Sharding Strategy**\n",
       "- **Primary Shards**: Start with a reasonable number of primary shards. A common approach is to have 1 primary shard for every 30-50GB of data. For 100GB daily, you might start with 3-5 primary shards per index.\n",
       "- **Replicas**: Set at least 1 replica for high availability. This means if you have 5 primary shards, you will have 5 replica shards, effectively doubling your storage needs.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### b. **Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)**\n",
       "- Implement ILM policies to manage indices over time. For example, you can roll over indices daily or weekly based on size or age, and delete older indices after a certain period to save space.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Data Ingestion and Processing**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Use **Bulk API** for data ingestion to optimize performance.\n",
       "- Consider using **Ingest Pipelines** for preprocessing data, such as parsing, enriching, or transforming documents before they are indexed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Query Optimization**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Use **Query DSL** effectively. Optimize your queries by:\n",
       "  - Using filters instead of queries when possible, as filters are cached.\n",
       "  - Avoiding wildcard queries on large datasets.\n",
       "  - Utilizing aggregations wisely to minimize resource consumption.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Implement monitoring tools like **OpenSearch Dashboards** or **Prometheus** to keep track of cluster health, node performance, and resource utilization.\n",
       "- Regularly check for slow queries and optimize them.\n",
       "- Set up alerts for critical metrics such as disk usage, CPU load, and memory usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Backup and Recovery**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Implement a snapshot strategy using the OpenSearch snapshot and restore feature. Schedule regular snapshots to a remote repository (e.g., S3) to ensure data durability.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. **Security Configuration**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Enable security features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption in transit and at rest. Use OpenSearch Security plugin for managing roles and permissions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example Configuration\n",
       "\n",
       "Assuming you have a cluster with 3 master nodes and 6 data nodes, here’s a simplified configuration:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Master Nodes**: 3 nodes (e.g., m5.large instances)\n",
       "- **Data Nodes**: 6 nodes (e.g., r5.large instances with 64GB RAM)\n",
       "- **Shards**: 5 primary shards per index, 1 replica\n",
       "- **Index Lifecycle Policy**: Roll over daily, delete indices older than 30 days\n",
       "- **Snapshot Policy**: Daily snapshots to S3\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these guidelines, you can configure your OpenSearch cluster to handle 100GB of data daily efficiently. Always monitor the performance and adjust the configuration as needed based on actual usage patterns and growth."

    "   - 🎓 **Question Answering**: Provide explanations and guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Configuration**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Basic configuration\n",
    "   {\n",
    "       \"type\": \"MLModelTool\",\n",
    "       \"parameters\": {\n",
    "           \"model_id\": \"model_id_here\",\n",
    "           \"prompt\": \"Your prompt template\"\n",
