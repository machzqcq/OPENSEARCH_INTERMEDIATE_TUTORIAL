    "# 🤝 AgentTool - Run Any Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AgentTool** is an OpenSearch ML Commons tool that enables an agent to run (call) any other registered agent. This is the foundation for building agent composition patterns and multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn:\n",
    "1. ✅ How to register an agent for AgentTool to call\n",
    "2. ✅ How to register a flow agent using AgentTool\n",
    "3. ✅ How to execute an agent via AgentTool\n",
    "4. ✅ Building multi-agent systems with agent delegation\n",
    "5. ✅ Best practices for agent composition\n",

    "**AgentTool** (introduced in OpenSearch 2.13) is a specialized tool that allows agents to call other agents. This enables:\n",
    "- 🏗️ **Agent Reuse**: Any registered agent can be called by other agents\n",
    "- 🤝 **Agent Composition**: Build complex workflows from simple agents\n",
    "- 🎯 **Task Delegation**: Agents can delegate to specialized agents\n",
    "- 📊 **Modular Design**: Break systems into independent, composable agents\n",

    "## 🎓 Best Practices and Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Patterns with AgentTool\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Delegation**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Orchestrator (AgentTool) → Base Agent → Result\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Agent Specialization**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Orchestrator A (AgentTool) → Specialist Agent A\n",
    "   Orchestrator B (AgentTool) → Specialist Agent B\n",
    "   Orchestrator C (AgentTool) → Specialist Agent C\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Delegation**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Coordinator (AgentTool calls Manager)\n",
    "   → Manager (AgentTool calls Worker)\n",
    "   → Worker (MLModelTool does work)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Constraints and Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Each agent can have ONE AgentTool** (not multiple)\n",
    "- ✅ **AgentTool forwards parameters** to the called agent\n",
    "- ✅ **Required parameter**: \"question\" when executing\n",
    "- ✅ **Use agent_id** to reference the agent to call\n",
    "- ✅ **Flow agents run tools in sequence** and return last tool's output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Pattern |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| Task delegation | Orchestrator → Specialist Agent |\n",
    "| Data pipeline | Sequential orchestrators calling each other |\n",
    "| Domain expertise | Each agent masters one domain |\n",
    "| Modular design | Reusable agents composed together |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Individual Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "According to OpenSearch docs, you can also test individual tools using the **Execute Tool API** for standalone operations."
